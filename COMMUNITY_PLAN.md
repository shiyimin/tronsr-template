1. **Cluster deployment** We will setup multiple disaster backup machines for super representatives node to form TRON SR cluster, as this is enterprise level data center infrastructure best practice.
Each backup machine generates same block in the meantime according to tron network super representatives protocol, and the supervisor (or load balance) application will pick block generated by master node.
2. **Automation devops** Supervisor application monitors TRON SR healthy status and pick the best one as master node.
The supervisor application monitors system resource usage in realtime, including: CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, IO r/w rate, network speed. The supervisor application alert devops team according predefined threshold value. For low risk events, the application handles them by predefined emergency plan.
The supervisor application also logs TRON SR node's performance data, including: block generate data, block miss rate, transaction data, UTXO, memory pool, smart contract deployment and execution data, dapp active rate.
3. **Security** In order to prevent any disaster scenarios, we will hire professional IT operation team to provides TRON SR operation work 24 hours a day.
Our TRON SR node applies minimum exposure security principle. We also provides anti DDOS attack defense system, to enhance TRON SR node's robustness.
4. **Data analysis and optimization** We will periodically do big data analysis and apply visualization technology, to help devops team identify performance bottleneck, and potential security risk.
5. **Ecosystem construction** The recent smart contract hack accidents happen on Etheruem mainnet reminds us, the we need a solid tool to help smart contract developer identify security issues as soon as possible. We will develop a security code review tool the review smart contract code, and provide warning and fix suggestions for common security issues.
